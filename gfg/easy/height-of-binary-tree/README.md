# Height of Binary Tree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the  **root** of a binary tree, find the maximum depth of the tree.

 **Note:** The maximum depth or height of the tree is the number of edges in the tree from the root to the deepest node.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: root = [12, 8, 18, 5, 11]

Output: 2
Explanation: One of the longest path from the root(node 12) goes through node 8 to node 5, which has 2 edges.
```

```
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, 10, 5, N, N, N, N, 6, 7]

Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path from the root(node 1) to a leaf node 6 with 3 edges.
```

```java
/* Structure of Binary Tree Node
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = null;
    }
}*/

class Solution {
    public int height(Node root) {
    
       if(root == null)
        return -1;
    
      return 1+Math.max(height(root.left),height(root.right));
    
    }
}
```
